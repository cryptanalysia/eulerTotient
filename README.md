# Euler totient function == Euler phi function

Also see the [Wikipedia Euler phi function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler%27s_totient_function).

Made three functions implementing the Euler Totient or Euler Phi function in julia. 
They rely on julia's factor() and seem to be faster than what I found online.
