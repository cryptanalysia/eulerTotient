# Euler totient function == Euler phi function

Also see the [Wikipedia page for the Euler phi function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler%27s_totient_function).

Made three functions implementing the Euler Totient or Euler Phi function in [Julia](julialang.org). 
They rely on Julia's factor() and seem to be faster than what I found online.
